# Files relevant for our submission
# 1. Train.py - This file contains the training script for JEPA model.
# 2. Models.py - This file contains all of our models with proper docstrings.
# 3. Dataset.py - This file contains our custom built dataset trajectory class for easy processing of the dataset.
# 4. src/ directory - This directory contains our testing scripts and jupyter notebooks which we used for testing purposes.


# Training command to replicate your submitted model
# 1. The JEPA model can be trained using the "train.py" file, which will generate "jepa_model_train.pth" as the resultant model in the "checkpoint" directory. 
# 2. Once the training for JEPA is completed, pls update line number 81 in the "main.py" file with the name (checkpoint/jepa_model_train.pth), to load the newly trained JEPA model and run the prober.
# 3. Command to run the training script for JEPA is:
python train.py


## Note ##
# For running the prober, we have currently provided our pre-trained JEPA model with the name (jepa_model) inside the "checkpoint" directory.
# And, we can train the prober using the main.py file with the given pretrained JEPA model (checkpoint/jepa_model.pth), using the below command:
# But, if you want to train the JEPA model first and then run the prober, please follow the steps mentioned above and make relevant changes.
python main.py
